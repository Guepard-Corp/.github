Guepard – Instant Database Branching for DevOps, DataOps & AI Teams 🚀

**Guepard** is a next-generation **data branching platform** that enables developers, data engineers, and AI teams to **provision, clone, and synchronize databases instantly**—without duplication, delays, or infrastructure overhead.

## **✨ Why Guepard?**
Traditional databases **aren’t built for speed and agility**. Developers waste hours provisioning environments, and AI teams struggle with real-time data access. Guepard fixes this by:

✅ **Instant database branching** – Create isolated test environments in seconds.  
✅ **Multi-database support** – PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse & more.  
✅ **Zero duplication, zero lag** – Intelligent storage efficiency.  
✅ **Real-time CDC & analytics** – Seamless integration to enable your database to the new world.  
✅ **Cloud & on-prem ready** – Deploy in **your** infrastructure or as a **fully-managed SaaS**.  
✅ **AI-driven automation** – Smart scaling & provisioning for DevOps & AI workloads.  

## **🚀 How It Works**
Guepard introduces a **Git-like approach** for databases:
1. **Create a branch** of your database without duplicating data.
2. **Run tests, analytics, or AI training** in an isolated environment.
3. **Sync changes or discard branches** instantly.
